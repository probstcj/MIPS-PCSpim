# PCSpim
## What it is

PCSpim is a MIPS R2000/R3000 simulator. It allows code that was written for those processors to be ran on modern processors. For CS286 at SIUE, we were required to be able to run this program and wrote multiple programs for it.

## How to run

To run PCSpim, you simply need to download the `PCSpim Executable` folder, and run the executable file. 

Once it is running, click Simulator, and go to Settings. Locate the Exception box and click the Browse button. Find the `exceptions.s` file and load it into PCSpim. This will allow you to run all the programs that are in their own repositories.
